## 💡 Motivation & Impact
Globally, financial illiteracy contributes to debt, missed savings, and economic stress. These challenges are made worse by the rising living costs combined with the convenience of online spending.
I’ve seen this firsthand in my community, where overspending is common and accessible tools are rare.

Driven by a passion for finance and computer science, I developed **FinTrack** as my CS50 final project with the goal of creating something that would outlive the course. I aimed to design a practical tool addressing this problem: a simple, web-based solution that empowers users to log their spending, set achievable savings goals, and make informed decisions about their money. This project reflects my commitment to using technology to solve real-world problems and my ability to create user-friendly solutions from concept to deployment.
